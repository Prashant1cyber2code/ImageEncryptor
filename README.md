# ImageEncryptor

This project implements a basic image encryption tool using Python. The tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images using a specified key. Encryption is performed by applying XOR operations to each pixel of the image.

Features:

1. Encrypt images by applying XOR with a specified key.

2. Decrypt encrypted images using the same key.

3. Supports common image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
